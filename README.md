Travello is a modern, responsive frontend prototype for a travel booking platform. This project was developed to practice and demonstrate proficiency in essential frontend technologies and modern UI/UX design principles.

The primary goal was to create an intuitive and visually appealing interface that simulates a real-world travel search and booking experience, without connecting to a live backend.
